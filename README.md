### Open Data Structure ###

This repository is for researching and experimenting with data structure. As structured data are more reliable and useful than unstructured one, finding a good possible way to organize the data is important. You are encouraged to check the data structure that exists in this repository and contribute to it, in the hope of helping the community directly or indirectly. This led to another concept, " Open Data Structure ".

For this repository, " Open Data Structure " means using the power of community or collective effort in developing a reliable data structure. Therefore, do not hesitate to contribute or fix as you please.

>Golang is the only programming language used in this repository. Therefore, if you develop a data structure to contribute to this repository, please use Golang. All of the data structure should be in its own branch to avoid conflict with one another. Git branch only from ' main ' to be included LICENSE.

>Empowerment of individuals is a key part of what makes open source work, since in the end, innovations tend to come from small groups, not from large, structured efforts.
